# skytap\_environment

Provides a Skytap Environment resource. An environment consists of one or more virtual machines, networks, 
and associated settings and metadata. Unlike a template, an environment can be run and have most of its settings 
modified. When an environment is created all of its VMs will be run.

## Example Usage


```hcl
# Create a new environment
resource "skytap_environment" "environment" {
  template_id = "123456"
  name = "Terraform Example"
  description = "Skytap terraform provider example environment."
}
```
